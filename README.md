# Mobile Flashcards Project

This is the code for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Native course.

The project consists of  an Android application that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app lets users create flashcards in the form of question/answer pairs, and store them in different categories called "decks" that the user also has access to create. Then the user can take quizzes for a particular deck, while the app tracks progress by allowing the user mark questions as correct or incorrect and offering a score at the end of a quiz. Finally, the app reminds the user to take a quiz through a notification every day at the same time, unless he has done so already by that time. 


## Getting Started

#### Important
